The code is mainly from [chroma](http://jeffersonlab.github.io/chroma/).

Ensure you have a [qdpxx](http://usqcd-software.github.io/qdpxx/) build to run the code. If you don't, follow the tutorial there to build one.

You may need to set `$(QDPXX)=/path/to/qdpxx/install` in `Makefile`. I set that as `CHROMA` in my environment.
