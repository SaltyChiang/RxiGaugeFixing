# ZetaGaugeFixing

This repo uses `Eigen` as the linear algebra library.

You should download `Eigen` [here](http://bitbucket.org/eigen/eigen/get/3.3.7.tar.bz2).

Extract the file and copy `Eigen` folder to the `./extensions` folder. If there doesn't exists `extensions`, add one.

The `Makefile` uses `clang` to build the program. If you want to use other compilers, please change the `Makefile`.
