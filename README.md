You need to add ```Eigen``` to the repo.

You can download ```Eigen``` [here](http://bitbucket.org/eigen/eigen/get/3.3.7.tar.bz2).

Extract the file and copy ```Eigen``` folder to the ```./extensions``` folder. If there doesn't exists ```extensions```, add one.

The ```Makefile``` uses ```clang``` to build the program. If you want to use other compilers, please chang the ```Makefile```.
